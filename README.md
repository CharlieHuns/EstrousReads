A MATLAB program designed to increase efficiency and reduce human bias associated with vaginal cytology classification.

To better understand the interplay between female estrous, glutamate, and cocaine use, we needed to analyze collected estrous slides via microscopy.

Implementation of a program designed to interpret variable fluorescent intensity linked with automated image detection streamlined this process. 

Currently working on increasing the robustness of the program by tweaking fluorescent level thresholds to increase the accuracy of the program's output reads.

HOW TO USE:
Take a snapshot of an estrous slide stained RGB and upload into matlab. This program will read the slide and based on the proportions of cell types associated with stages of estrous
produce an output of what estrous stage the animal is in
